# Introduction-of-12-Basic-React-Native-Components
Introduction of 12 Basic React Native Components includes the overview and basic understanding of React Native basic components.

1. View
View is like a container view. (Ex. Linear layout, Relative layout etc) for mobile developers and for web developers it is like <div>.

2. Text
Text is like TextView/Label for mobile developers and for web developers, it is like <p>.

3. State
State in React Native is like binding the value of any variable with any component, which will change when we change the value using setState. For example, if we made a state variable called varx and showing the value of varx in text view it will show the default value of varx but any time when we change the value of varx it will update automatically and will show the new value of varx (Same as ng-modal in Angular). Initialize state in the constructor, and then call setState when we want to change it.

4. Props
React Native components have some props which are helpful to customize the component. For example placeholder, Value, Style etc. These are props.

The state is mutable while props are immutable. This means that state can be updated in the future while props cannot be updated.
